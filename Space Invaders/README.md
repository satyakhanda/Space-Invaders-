Welcome to this Lecture Lab :sparkles:

---

:heavy_check_mark: Task 1

1. Using IntelliJ, clone this repository and open it.
2. Draw the **package relationship diagram** for the system.

---

:heavy_check_mark: Task 2

Extract a **call graph** starting from the `GamePanel.drawGame` method. Do not include calls to methods in the Java library.

---

:heavy_check_mark: Task 3

Draw a **flowchart** for `SIGame.checkMissiles`.

----

:heavy_check_mark: Task 4

Now run the program and play the game:

1. Why the tank does not move?
2. How do you quit the game?

----

:heavy_check_mark: Task 5

As you must have noticed, the `Tank` class contains only _specification_ of its methods. We are going to implement these but first we shall write a comprehensive suit of tests for the `Tank` class. 

* Open `TankTest` in `tests` package; using the specification of methods in `Tank` class, write a comprehensive unit tests.

----

:heavy_check_mark: Task 6

Implement all the methods in the `Tank` class until all the tests in `TankTest` pass successfully. 

----

:heavy_check_mark: Task 7

Now run the game again and enjoy playing it :checkered_flag:
